      <h1>About Us</h1>

      <div>
        <p>Every dot tells a story.</p>
        <p>
          Ours began in the heart of Kachchh where colors dance under the desert
          sun and Bandhani is more than fabric, itâ€™s heritage, itâ€™s pride, itâ€™s
          patience woven by hands that know art better than words.
        </p>
        <p>
          At Aainal Bandhani, we donâ€™t just sell sarees or dupattas we carry
          forward generations of artistry. Each piece is tied, dyed and dreamed
          by skilled artisans who learned the craft not from books, but from
          life itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          We believe true beauty lies in imperfections in the uneven dots, in
          the tiny knots that hold stories of mothers, daughters and festivals
          gone by. Thatâ€™s what makes every Bandhej piece truly one-of-a-kind.
        </p>
